/**
 * Let's define the GraphQL fragment needed for the component to function.
 *
 * GraphQL fragment colocation keeps queries near the components using them,
 * improving maintainability and encapsulation. Fragment composition enables
 * building complex queries from reusable parts, promoting code reuse and
 * efficiency. Together, these practices lead to more modular, maintainable, and
 * performant GraphQL implementations by allowing precise data fetching and
 * easier code management.
